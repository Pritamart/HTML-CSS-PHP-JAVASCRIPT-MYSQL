PHP script explained:

$target_dir = "uploads/" - specifies the directory where the file is going to be placed
$target_file specifies the path of the file to be uploaded

The global predefined variable $_FILES is an associative array containing items uploaded via HTTP POST method. Uploading a file requires HTTP POST method form with enctype attribute set to multipart/form-data.$_FILES['file']['name']

PHP basename() function: Returns filename from the specified path
PHP pathinfo() function: Get information about a file path
getimagesize() function: In-built function used to get the size of an image. This function accepts the filename as a parameter and determines the image size and returns the dimensions with the file type and height/width of image.

$imageFileType holds the file extension of the file (in lower case)
Next, check if the image file is an actual image.
Note: You will need to create a new directory called "uploads" in the directory where "Upload.php" file resides. The uploaded files will be saved there.


Checking if file already exists:
First, we will check if the file already exists in the "uploads" folder.
If it does, an error message is displayed, and $uploadOk is set to 0:

if (file_exists($target_file)) {
	echo "Sorry, file already exists.";
	$uploadOk = 0;
}


Limit file size:
The file input field in HTML form is named "fileToUpload".
Now, we want to check the size of the file. If the file is larger than 500 KN, an error message is displayed, and $uploadOk is set to 0.


Check file size:
if ($_FILES['fileToUpload']['size'] > 500000) {
	echo "Sorry, your file is too large";
	$uploadOk = 0;
}


Limit file type:
The code below only allows users to upload JPG, JPEG, PNG and GIF files. All other file types give an error message before setting $uploadOk to 0.



Allow certain file formats:
if ($imageFileType != 'jpg' && $imageFileType != 'png' && $imageFileType != 'jpeg' && $imageFileType != 'gif') {
	echo "Sorry, only JPG, JPEG, PNG and GIF files are allowed.";
	$uploadOk = 0;
}
